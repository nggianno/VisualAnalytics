ABILA, Kronos  Two years ago yesterday Elian Karel died at age 28 in an Abila jail cell, purportedly of cardiac arrest.  After Karel������s body was cremated and sent to his family in Elodis, the Abila Chief of Police closed the case and has declined to answer questions about Karels death stating that we are satisfied the death was of natural causes and will no longer be entertaining inquiries.

As reported at the time of Karels death, several people close to the investigation reported that Karels body showed signs of blunt force trauma, abrasions and lacerations which were not consistent with the cause of death reported by the police.

Police have denied anything unusual happened in Karels death and city officials claim the accusations of murder and wrongful death are asserted by POK rabble-rousers attempting to incite instability and violence.
